They get evaluated only during the compile-time and have no significance during the run-time of the code. They do not have any significance or meaning associated with them until accessed by some third-party libraries. They are used to type check the functions by declaring the type of the parameters and the return value for the functions. The string-based annotations help us to improve the help messages.\n",
